## Indicator Inspector - Local Model

This repository contains the **Local Model** for the Indicator Inspector project. It is designed for air-gapped, offline environments that require strict compliance with standards such as **CMMC**, **ITAR**, and **FIPS**. This model operates independently of any live threat feeds or cloud-based LLMs.

### 🎯 Key Features

- Fully offline IOC enrichment and scoring
- Designed for secure, compliance-focused environments (CMMC/ITAR)
- Pure Python (no external packages required)
- Easily auditable logic and data flow

---

### ⚠️ Compliance Note

This model does **not** connect to the internet and does not contain any automatic API integrations. Users must manually provide threat intelligence datasets (e.g., AbuseIPDB exports, ThreatFox dumps) in the `data/` directory.

This aligns with:
- CMMC Level 2 control: `SC.L2-3.13.15` (network isolation)
- ITAR control: `22 CFR 120-130` (technical data protection)
- FIPS 199/200 recommendations for information system categorization

For internal validation, all code and data files can be reviewed and hashed to generate a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM).

### 🔐 Agentic Model

The **Agentic Model** is a **restricted component** of Indicator Inspector and is not included in this repository. It includes:
- API integrations with VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB, ThreatFox, and OTX
- LLM-driven triage and enrichment agents
- Automated playbook inference and remediation logic

This separation allows the Local Model to remain open-source and secure, while the Agentic Model is reserved for environments that support external connectivity and advanced automation.

---

### ✅ Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- No internet access required
- Runs on Windows, Linux, or macOS

### 🤝 Contributions
At this time, contributions are not being accepted as the project is undergoing internal validation.

The Local Model is provided openly for review, evaluation, and deployment in secure environments, but all development is currently maintained in a closed governance model to ensure alignment with emerging cybersecurity standards.

Please check back in the future for contribution opportunities.
